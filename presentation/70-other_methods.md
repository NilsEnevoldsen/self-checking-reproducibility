# Other methods

## Non-technical means

- Use a new computer
- Have an undergraduate student run it
- Ask your office neighbor to run it

## More technical means {auto-animate=true}

- [Virtual Machines](https://larsvilhuber.github.io/self-checking-reproducibility/72-virtual_machines.html)
- [Use of containers](https://larsvilhuber.github.io/self-checking-reproducibility/80-docker.html)

## Use of containers {auto-animate=true}

- **Containers** are a way to simulate a "computer within a computer", which can be used to run code in an isolated environment. 
- They are relatively lightweight, and are *starting* to be used as part of replication packages in economics (but **only 0.13% of 8280 packages**...)

## Use of containers {auto-animate=true}

- They do not work in all situations, and require some **more advanced technical skills** (typically Linux, in addition to the statistical software).
- Using containers to test for reproducibility is easier, and should be considered as part of a toolkit. 
- Several **online services** make such testing (and development) easy.
