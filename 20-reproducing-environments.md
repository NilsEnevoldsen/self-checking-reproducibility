# Reproducing and documenting environments

There is a difference between documenting environments after the fact, and creating environments. We describe two methods of allowing others to reproduce environments.

## TL;DR

- Provide a documentation of what your environment looks like when you run it
- Provide instructions on how to create the minimal environment needed to run your code
