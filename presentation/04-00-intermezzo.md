*I want to get ahead of the game...*

*Somebody will ask "but I have confidential data..."*

# So what happens when...

## You cannot share a file {auto-animate=true}

## The file no longer exists on the internet {auto-animate=true}

## The code takes ages to run  {auto-animate=true}

How can you show that you actually ran the code?

*The question of how to provide access confidential data is a separate issue, with no simple solution.*
